# Detecting Malicious Attacks Through The Network Traffic

By(Hatim Alshehri & Fahad Alnafisa)

# Abstract:
The network intrusion detection system (NIDS) has become an essential tool for detecting attacks in computer networks and protecting the critical information and systems. The effectiveness of an NIDS is usually measured by the high number of detected attacks and the low number of false alarms. Machine learning techniques are widely used for building robust intrusion detection systems, which adapt with the continuous changes in the network attacks. However, a comparison of such machine learning techniques needs more investigation to show their efficiency and appropriateness for detecting sophisticated malicious attacks.
The project goal is to detect and examine network traffic from malicious attacks by generating a machine learning model to classify the network traffic.


# Data:
This data set has a hybrid of the real modern normal and the contemporary synthesized attack activities of the network traffic. Existing and novel methods are utilised to generate the features of the UNSW- NB15 data set. This data set is available [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files%2Fa%20part%20of%20training%20and%20testing%20set).

*  The obtained dataset consists of over 250,000 network traffic records with 45 features.
